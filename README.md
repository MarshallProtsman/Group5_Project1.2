# Project Title: 
Shrug (date night planning app)

# Team Members: 
Chaney Durham, Marshall Prostman, John Robertson

# Project Description: 
Web Application designed to facilitate the planning of dates.
Users will be guided through a date planner sequentially.
The initial user location is 

# APIs:
ipdata.io - used to obtain the users initial location (city)
ticketmaster - used to search for events based on the location (city) provided by ipdata.io 
yelp - used to populate a list of restaurants near the users event selection (latitude and longitude coordinates)

# Libraries
materialize.css - basic responsive layout and some transition effects
hover.css - dedicated css library for hover effects
jquery - dom manipulation and view management 

# Future Versioning - Enhancements and Features
- User account and login validation via firebase (to store history, favorite restaurants, leave reviews, etc.)
- Multiple search keywords for events (most of this is coded already and commented out)
- Advanced event and dining serach filtering
- Categories for dining options and the ability to search
- Date Picker and date-based functionality 
- In-app purchase of event tickets (or a more integrated functionaliy eliminating the need to leave the app/site)
- Google Maps integration (distance from event to restaurant is already here - we want advanced functionality like showing the map and directions)
- Advanced animations/transitions and a smoother UI (android-like)
